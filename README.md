# Tiddy-Tides
Small Alexa skill to get the tides of a specific river.  Could be adapted to get the tide of another location or even extended to give the user the option to choose a location.

You can activate the skill (once set up in Amazon developer portal) by saying:

Alexa ask the river when is the next high/low tide  or  Alexa ask the river what its doing

Of simply say Alexa open the river and she will tell you the commands you can use to invoke the skill.

Refer to the scheme for the list of Alexa intents - note some are unused at present.
